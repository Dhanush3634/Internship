WHY I CHOOSE?

A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. 
This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.
All things considered super market is easy and well categorised shop than some other road-side markets.
